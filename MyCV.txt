I'm an aspiring Junior Web Developer. I have always had a compultion towards "Tech" and computers, my first computer was a Commodore 64 so feel free to do the math..

After 20+ years working in the Industrial Insulation and Metal Fabrication sector making use of a multitude of different automated machine systems such as various "Brake Press" and "Folding" machines to different generations of Mabi automated cutting and fabricating machines, i realised that in another 10 years all fabricators will need to learn at least a little Python and maybe some JavaScipt along with some networking and possibly some Machine Learning Modeling.

This is what inspired me to refocus my attention on my software development skills by building a few different web site's, Api's and databases in order to familiarise myself with standard work practices such as automated testing and CL/CD .

I have always had a compultion towards "Tech" and computers, my first computer was a Commodore 64 so feel free to do the math..

Having witnessed the begining of the "World Wide Web" and watching the speed at which it has evolved in a very short time im now absolutley enfatuated with the manner in which we are storing, updating and accesing information globaly in an instance.

The "Api" seems to be the medium worthy of most attention. From earthquake warning systems to a sensor in your fridge that tells you when to buy cheese.
